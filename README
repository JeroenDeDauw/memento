This package contains the source code, build scripts, and tests for the Memento Mediawiki Extension.

Note: the released version of this extension does not contain this file, so the target audience for this file is those who wish to build/maintain the source code.

## Packaging

To package the Memento Mediawiki Extension, type the following 
from this directory:

    make package

This serves to run everything needed to verify the code and package the zip for release.

## Deployment and Integration Tests

To deploy the Memento Mediawiki Extension for testing, one must first indicate
to the shell where Mediawiki is installed, then run the appropriate make target.

    export MWDIR=<where your Mediawiki is installed>
    make deploy

Once the code is deployed, the integration tests can be run.

    export TESTHOST=<hostname of your Mediawiki server to test>
    make integration-test

Note that the tests will fail if the software is not deployed.

To remove the software from a Mediawiki instance, type:

    make undeploy

Note: you will need to change the test data inside tests/integration/test-data to reflect your Mediawiki installation URIs and appropriate expected data.  Seeing as Mementos vary from URI-R to URI-R, it was decided not to come up with a "one size fits all" integration test set.  Perhaps in the future.
